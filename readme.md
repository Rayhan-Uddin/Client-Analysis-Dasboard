**Dashboard Overview**

##Dashboard Name: Client Analysis Dashboard ##
The Client Analysis Dashboard is a comprehensive data visualization tool designed to provide insights into customer behavior, product performance, regional trends, and key metrics for a 
retail store. The dashboard integrates data from multiple CSV files, utilizes data modeling techniques, and employs various DAX functions and formulas to extract meaningful insights.

**Data Collection and Preparation Data Source:**

The project involves collecting data from various CSV files containing customer details, product details, regional information, brand details, and product returns.

**Data Integration:** 

A new CSV file named "fact table" was created, which consolidates data from all the different datasets. Each table was loaded into Excel using the "Save and Load" 
option to establish connections.

**Data Modeling:**

Data from different tables was connected through relationships using Excel's data modeling feature. This allowed for seamless data interaction and manipulation across tables.

**DAX Functions and Formulas**

Various DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions and formulas were employed to calculate important metrics and insights. The following functions were utilized:
COUNT, COUNTA, SUM, COUNTROWS, CALCULATE: These functions were used to perform aggregations, counts, and calculations based on different data attributes.
IF, IFS: These logical functions were applied to create conditional calculations and evaluate different scenarios.
DATEADD, DATE: These date functions were used to analyze time-based data and calculate date differences.
SUMX: This function allowed for the calculation of a sum over an expression within a table.

**Key Metrics and Insights**

Numerous measures were created within the "All Measures" CSV file to derive valuable insights:

Total Gross Profit
Total Revenue
Revenue from Male and Female customers

**Dashboard Design:**

The dashboard is designed to highlight key insights in a user-friendly format. It includes graphical representations, charts, and tables for easy comprehension.

**Slicers:**

Three slicers were added to the dashboard, enabling dynamic filtering based on Year, Month, and Country. This feature allows users to 
focus on specific data subsets.

`The dashboard clearly indicates that the most profitable year across all three countries (USA, Canada, Mexico) was 2021.
December emerges as the best-selling month, with fewer return orders, signifying a successful holiday season.`

The "Client Analysis Dashboard" successfully brings together data from multiple sources, models it effectively, and extracts meaningful insights using DAX
functions and formulas. This tool provides actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance, aiding decision-making processes
